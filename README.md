# Driver-Drowsiness-System-
This Driver Drowsiness Detection System uses OpenCV and Dlib to monitor the driver's eye aspect ratio (EAR). If the EAR falls below a threshold for a set duration, it triggers an alert by playing a sound. The system helps in preventing accidents caused by drowsy driving.
